## üôè Original Work

This project is built upon the excellent foundation provided by the **mem0 team** and their OpenMemory project.

### Original Project
- **Repository**: [mem0ai/mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)
- **OpenMemory Path**: `/openmemory` directory within the mem0 repository
- **Team**: mem0.ai team and contributors
- **License**: See original repository for licensing terms

### What We Built Upon
- **Core OpenMemory Architecture**: FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, Qdrant integration
- **Docker Configuration**: Multi-container orchestration
- **MCP Server Implementation**: Model Context Protocol integration
- **Database Models**: SQLAlchemy models and relationships
- **UI Components**: React components and styling foundation

## üîß Our Enhancements

While respecting the original work, we made significant enhancements to transform OpenMemory into a multi-user collaboration platform:

### Privacy Enhancements
- **Removed OpenAI Dependencies**: Eliminated external API calls for categorization
- **Local-First Architecture**: All processing happens on your infrastructure
- **No Data Leakage**: Complete control over your memory data

### Multi-User System
- **User Isolation**: Complete separation between users' memories
- **Beautiful UI**: Professional user switching with colored avatars
- **Auto-User Creation**: Seamless onboarding for new users
- **Dynamic User Display**: Shows memory creators in the interface

### Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Database Schema**: Proper user relationships and constraints
- **Fixed MCP Integration**: Resolved sync issues between components
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error recovery
- **Production-Ready**: Professional deployment configuration
